## 2.5" SATA Drive Support
Support for 2.5" SATA was planned but sourcing PCIe-SATA host controllers was not possible for individuals, this being the same issue with finding video bridge ICs.

Mounting for an 2.5" drive may be available as it may be possible to use an off-the-shelf M.2 NVMe-SATA adapter to provide SATA.
