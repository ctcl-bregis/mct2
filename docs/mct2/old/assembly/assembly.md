## PCBA
MediaCow Touch 2 is expected to use a vast amount of components with numbers in the hundreds, possibly over a thousand. This may have hand-assembly impractical.

This poses a major challenge with being able to assemble these devices. PCBA services at quantities expected, being one to five, may be prohibitively expensive. The best course of action is to find a local place that has a pick-and-place (PNP) machine.
