The carrier board has one M.2 Key B slot and one M.2 Key E slot for adding Wi-Fi/Bluetooth and cellular connectivity. This was common with older laptops though is unfortunately not seen in many modern devices where instead the wireless module is soldered onto the motherboard. Though it is understandable in some cases where size is important, such as the [Valve Steam Deck](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Steam+Deck+Chip+ID/147811).

Providing wireless connectivity through M.2 slots allows for wireless to be an optional feature, leading to both privacy and security benefits. Another benefit is that wireless modules can be easily replaced for repairability and security purposes.

## Ethernet
MediaCow Touch 2 provides a single gigabit Ethernet port for wired networking. Like wireless, wired networking is also provided by an M.2 module. While allowing the Ethernet NIC to be replaced or removed, this would simplify the carrier board design by not having to implement the Ethernet controller on the carrier board.
