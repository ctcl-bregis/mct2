## Naming
In 2025, MediaCow Touch 2 was split into two projects: MediaCow Touch 2 and MediaCow Touch 2 Lite. 

MediaCow Touch 2 "Paris" is refered to as the "Full" version and has all of the features introduced during development in 2024 including the SP7021 as the embedded controller, the side-mounted display and modular connectors.

MediaCow Touch 2 Lite "Curitiba" is the version of the project introduced in 2025 that leaves out many features to decrease development time and cost.
